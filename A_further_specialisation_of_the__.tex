A further specialisation of the mass budget is obtained when flows happens through networks. In this case
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM_k^{(l)}}{dt} =  A^{(lm)}_k Q_k^{(m)}+ \sum_{j=1^r} \langle\nu \rangle_{ki}^{(l)} \langle J_i \rangle^{(l)}
\end{equation}
where the indexes $l$ and $m$ indicates two arcs (links) of the network, and $A^{(lm)}_k$ is an adjacency matrix with entries $a^{(lm)}=1$ when the matter flux of link $m$ enters in $l$, $a^{(lm)}= - 1$ when the matter flux of link $l$ enters in $m$, and $a^{(lm)}=0$ otherwise.
