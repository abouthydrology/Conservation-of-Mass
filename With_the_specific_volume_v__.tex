With the specific volume $v:=\rho^{-1}$ formula (\ref{dGM11}) may also be written as
\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{dv}{dt} = \nabla \vec{v}
\label{dGM13}
\end{equation}
We note also that it follows from (\ref{dGM7}) and (\ref{dGM9}) that 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^n \vec{J}_k =0 
\label{dGM15}
\end{equation}
which means that only $n-1$ of the $n$ diffusion flows are independent.
Similarly, only $n-1$ of the $n$ equations (\ref{dGM13}) are independent. In fact by summing (\ref{dGM13}) over all $k$, both members vanish identically as a result of (\ref{dGM4}), (\ref{dGM12}) and (\ref{dGM15}). The $n^{th}$ independent equations describing the change of mass density within the system is now equation (\label{dGM14}).

We note finally that the following relation, valid for an arbitrary local property $a$, (which maybe a scalar ot a component of a vector or tensor, etc):
\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{da}{dt} = \frac{d a\rho}{} + \nabla ( a \rho \vec{v})
\label{dGM16}
\end{equation}
is a consequence of the mass equation (\label{dGM5}) and of (\label{dGM8})
