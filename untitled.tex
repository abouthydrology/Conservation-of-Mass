\subsection{Introduction}

"Thermodynamics is based on two fundamental laws: the first law of thermodynamics or law of conservation of energy, and the second law of thermodynamics or entropy law".  I actually disagree with this. Equilibrium thermodynamics is. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is not. Non equilibrium thermodynamics is based instead on the law of conservation of energy, the law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of momentum. Entropy is just a part of the subdivision of internal energy of a body or of a system. The conservation of these quantities, in non relativistic conditions, is given for granted by the structure of the macroscopic space-time, and is particularly evident when mechanics is formulated in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics}{Lagrangian terms} [CITE]. This is the results of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem}{NÃ¶ther theorem}.
