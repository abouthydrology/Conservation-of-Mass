Fluxes in the r.h.s member of (\ref{dGM2}) can be, obbiously seen also at the integrated scale, where we have then:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM_k}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out} + sum_{j=1^r} \langle\nu \rangle_{ki} J_i
\end{equation}
where $\langle\nu \rangle_{ki}$ represent a spatially averaged value of $\nu_{ki}$.
