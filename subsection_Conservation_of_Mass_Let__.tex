\subsection{Conservation of Mass}

"Let us consider a system consisting of $n$ components amongst which $r$ chemical reactions are possible. 
The rate of change of the mass of component $k$ within a given volume $V$ is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\int^V \rho_k dV = \int^V \frac{\partial \rho_k}{\partial t}\, dV
\end{equation}
